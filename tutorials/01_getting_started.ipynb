The tool will let you know when things are missing and/or need to be fixed in a context dependent manner, in order to minimize busy-work [sighs]. Additionally, there are many checks happening behind the scence to make sure the inputs are right and that the creation of the PRS is happening correctly. This means that even the PRS-uninitialed can build powerfull polygenic risk scores in no time. For the ones who might be interested, prstools can also be used inside of a python environment and is designed for that.<br>\n",

    "As we an see there is also a \"Number of workers\" specified. If you are running this code on a powerfull system you can specify a large number of workers. For instance, giving the option `--n_jobs 22` would spin up 22 workers which can then do the PRS model creation for the 22 chromosome in parallel, leading to a big decrease in overall runtime. Increasing the number of workers above 22 will not lead to a decrease in runtime since there are only 22 tasks in this case. If we set `--n_jobs 22` the 22 workers would require about 22\\*1=22 cores and approximately 2GB\\*22=44GB of RAM to run. Increasing the number of cores using the `--cpus` option will only lead to a modest decrease in runtime if enough cores are availabe. If one would set `--cpus 2` this would require 22 workers * 2 cpus = 44 total cores. If the required number of cores is higher than the available cores this can substantially decrease computational efficiency.\n"
